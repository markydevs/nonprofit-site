# All for Copts

All for Copts is a web project designed to highlight the mission and services of a non-profit organization aimed at helping minority widows, orphans, and needy families in rural Upper Egypt. Although the project did not proceed to become an actual nonprofit due to business constraints, it serves as a strong example of web development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
